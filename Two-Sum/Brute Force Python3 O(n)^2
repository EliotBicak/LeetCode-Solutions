# Given an array of integers (nums) and an integer (target) retur indices of the two numbers such that they add up to (target).

# *You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# *You can return the answer in any order

Brute Force Solution:

class Solution: 
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                sum = nums[i] + nums[j]
                if sum == target:
                    return [i, j]

solution = Solution()

result = solution.twoSum([1, 4, 7, 9, 12, 14, 3, 2, 5, 8], 12)

print(result)
